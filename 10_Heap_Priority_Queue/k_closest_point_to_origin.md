# 973. K Closest Point to Origin
### Company: Meta

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance `(i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2)`.

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

 

Example 1:


Input: `points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = `1
Output: `[[-2,2]]`
Explanation:
```
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

Example 2:

Input: `points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2`
Output: `[[3,3],[-2,4]]`

Explanation: The answer `[[-2,4],[3,3]`] would also be accepted.

        # Calculate the squared distance for each point and add it to the minHeap
        for x, y in points:
            dist = (x ** 2) + (y ** 2)  # Calculate the squared Euclidean distance

        # Pop the top k points from the minHeap and add them to the result list
        for _ in range(k):
            _, x, y = heapq.heappop(minHeap)  # Extract the point with the smallest distance
            res.append((x, y))  # Add the point (x, y) to the result list
        
        return res  # Return the list of k closest points
